Algorithm Challenge #35 – Piggy Bank Calculator
-
🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge focuses on calculating the total value of coins stored in a piggy bank.
The program receives the number of coins in various denominations, converts them into cents, and then calculates the equivalent value in US dollars.

This exercise strengthens arithmetic logic, unit conversion skills, and console input/output handling in C++.

💰 Supported Denominations
-
Coin Type	Value (in cents)
Penny	1¢
Nickel	5¢
Dime	10¢
Quarter	25¢
Dollar	100¢

🧠 How It Works
-
The program multiplies the quantity of each coin by its value in cents:

Total Cents =

)
Total Cents=(penny×1)+(nickel×5)+(dime×10)+(quarter×25)+(dollar×100)

Then it converts cents into dollars:

Total Dollars =

Total Dollars=

🧩 Example
-
Input:
Penny: 10
Nickel: 4
Dime: 3
Quarter: 2
Dollar: 1

Output:
Total in cents: 195
Total in dollars: $1.95
